# CE1
CE1 is made as an extra layer to VM obfuscation. In a day and age where VM lua obfuscation is slowly becoming less secure, we have decided to make a tool where you can add an extra layer of protection onto your scripts. This may decrease performance a little, however in the long run it helps create a secure shield onto your scripts.

## How does this work?
Mostly all features of this are actually runtime protection, and this is common in most obfuscation. An example of this is string encryption, most obfuscation programs (and ours!) decrypt strings at runtime and store them in memory for later use, and this technique is really good especially with debugger protection enabled (another feature we also have!)

## Performance & Security
CE1 brings low-level language obfuscation techniques to lua, we love breaking the boundaries and adding never before seen features into the market, and without high performance loss either (seriously! you can't even realise its there).
